                <!-- Paragraph with story details -->
                <p>
                    Several years ago, a boy named Nata was discovered near the border of the Forbidden lands, an uncharted region believed by
                    the Guild to be uninhabited. Nata recounts how his village was attacked by a mysterious monster. In response, the Guild has
                    organized an expedition to investigate. The Hunter is assigned to one of the units tasked with investigating the "White Wraith"
                    and rescuing Nata's people known as the Keepers.

                <p>
                    Dynamic, ever-changing environments. A story of monsters and humans in a world with 2 faces: one in which the lands are harsh and
                    unforgiving, where the monsters fight for scant resources â€” and another in which the lands are vibrant and brimming with life. You play as
                    a professional monster hunter, protecting the balance of the ecosystem and hunting monsters. Use the resources you gain from hunts to craft
                    ever more powerful weapons and armor in your quest to unravel the mysteries of the new lands. Experience the most evolved action and improved
                    immersion in any Monster Hunter to date.
