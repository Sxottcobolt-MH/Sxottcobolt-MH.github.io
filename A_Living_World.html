            Fallow, a period when hungry predators roam the land in search of food, is followed by an ecology-altering
            Inclemency, leading to a rich period of Plenty. The same locale may look completely different between
            depending on 2 seasons. Each environment is inhabited by its own apex predator, which will appear during the 
            area's Inclemency.</p>

            In the Forbidden Lands, you'll encounter not only herds of small monstersâ€”some of the large monsters of the region may also form packs.
            Each group has its own place in the ecosystem, with its own unique movements and behaviours.</p>
